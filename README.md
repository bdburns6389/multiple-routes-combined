This app shows a very small example of how to better abstract routes into their own files. All routes will be placed in a common 'routes' folder, then an index.js file will combine them all together to send to the entry point (in this case index.js), to be required in. This not only allows for a cleaner organizing of routes, but also allow the entry point file to not be cluttered with handling routing functions.
